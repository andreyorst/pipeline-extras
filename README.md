# pipeline-extras

Fixed version of `pipeline*` (no off-by-two error in `pipeline-async` [ASYNC-163](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/ASYNC-163)), as well as unordered versions of all pipeline functions.
Requires but doesn't include [clojure.core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) as a dependency.
Should work on both JVM Clojure and ClojureScript.
